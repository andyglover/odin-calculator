# odin-calculator
calculator project for the odin project fundamentals
 
I've applied what I've learned from the Odin Project Javascript Foundations. This project tested my abilities!

Some challenging pieces of this project were:
-The percentage button functionality
-Strings of operations evaluated one after another
-Subsequent presses of the equals button

I feel like I've got plenty still to learn about JavaScript and programming, but I'm proud of my progress!
