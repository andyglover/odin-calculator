# odin-calculator
This project is live at: https://www.andyglover.io/odin-calculator/
 
I've applied what I've learned from the Odin Project Javascript Foundations. This project tested my abilities!

Some challenging pieces of this project were:
-The percentage button functionality
-Strings of operations evaluated one after another
-Subsequent presses of the equals button

I feel like I've got plenty still to learn about JavaScript and programming, but I'm proud of my progress!
